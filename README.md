The app is made in Kotlin MVVM architecture which makes is more reusable and maintainable.
Here are few of the major library and functionality that i've used 
-> Dagger hilt for dependency injection
-> Retrofit Library for API handling
-> RxJava for managing tasks
-> Firebase Auth for authenticating users
-> Bindable Adapter for recycler view 
-> Nested Recycler view for showing all sort of news at once
-> Data Binding for clean code
